# meta.vim

A colorscheme that uses the Terminal's normal 16 colors. The colorscheme
you actually want should be implemented via a Terminal theme.

This has the advantage of letting people use the same colorscheme 
locally and on remote servers. It will also let people use their own
colorscheme when using something like tmux or screen.
